# An-analysis-of-covid-19-in-Mexico

The Grouping_Function folder comes with a .rar file. The file comes with a function called "table" that allows grouping with some basic calculations: percentage change at one day, percentage change at seven days, and relative frequency. The explanation of the function can be found in analisis_utils / analisis_utils.R and some examples of how to use the function can be found in analisis.R in the root folder.

I am still working on the function to make it easier to understand and some graphs can be made.
